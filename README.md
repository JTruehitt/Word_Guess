# Word Guess

## Description
In this optional mini project for the UCF Coding Bootcamp, Module 4, I developed a word guess game using javascript. In an effort to save some time, I utilized the work/hint list provided by CodingNepal, and utilized their youtube video on this subject as a guide. I did however have to re-imagine the win conditions, as CodingNepal did not seem to take into account words with 2 or more of the same letter. To get around this, I determined the unique characters of each word and then measured that vs the correct letters to define the win condition. 

This app is NOT created with mobile in mind. I was specifically focused on learning the JS concepts. Sorry for any inconvenience!

In creating this app, I furthered my knowledge around some of the following skills:

- DOM manipulation
- saving data to and pulling data from local storage
- creating and accessing properties of objects
- timed operations via setInterval
- looping through arrays and objects
- event listeners
